The Eco-Hydrodynamics Research Group (Eco-Hydro Group), led by Prof. Yuncheng Xu from China Agricultural University, primarily focuses on scientific and engineering issues related to the coupling between biological (animal/plant) behaviors and hydrodynamic environments in research fields such as hydraulic engineering, agricultural engineering, and environmental engineering. Specific research topics include but are not limited to: field applications of quadruped robots, research on intelligent collaborative control technology for variable rate irrigation of large-scale sprinkler irrigation systems, hydrodynamic-based research on mussel self-organization behavior, biological fouling in water conveyance and transfer projects, and development of CFD models based on OpenFOAM.
<br><br> 
The research group comprehensively adopts multi-scale theoretical modeling methods, combined with tools such as the OpenFOAM open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform, ROS2 robot operating system, and Python numerical analysis tools, to construct targeted multi-physics field coupling models. Among them, CFD models focus on analyzing the hydrodynamic mechanisms of mussel self-organization behavior and the formation mechanism of biological fouling in water conveyance and transfer projects; the ROS2 system supports the field motion control and operation path optimization of quadruped robots; and numerical analysis tools assist in the matching of hydrodynamic parameters and the construction of collaborative control logic for variable rate irrigation of large-scale sprinkler irrigation machines, thereby systematically deciphering the material transport and momentum transfer mechanisms during the interaction between organisms and hydrodynamic environments. In the research process, relying on a multi-dimensional research system consisting of high-precision indoor flume experiments (suitable for microcosmic research such as mussel behavior observation and hydrodynamic parameter calibration), field in-situ monitoring (serving macro application research such as the operation verification of quadruped robots and the effect evaluation of variable rate irrigation by sprinkler irrigation machines), and numerical simulation verification, the group deeply integrates interdisciplinary theories including behavioral biology, agricultural engineering, and fluid mechanics. Focusing on the key scientific issues in the aforementioned hydraulic engineering, agricultural engineering, and environmental engineering fields, the group carries out full-chain research from the observation of microcosmic biofluid mechanics phenomena (such as mussel self-organization and microcosmic processes of biological fouling) to macro engineering applications (such as intelligent irrigation equipment regulation, field robot operations, and optimization of water conveyance and transfer systems). It is committed to revealing the dynamic essence of the coupling effect between organisms and the water environment, and providing theoretical support and technical solutions for the optimal design of biological fouling prevention and control in water conveyance and transfer systems, the innovation of intelligent irrigation technology for large-scale sprinkler irrigation machines, the field application of quadruped robots, river ecological restoration projects, and the research and development of bionic robots.
